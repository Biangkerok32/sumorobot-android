sumodroid
=========

this is a very experimental project, just here to give you an idea that this is possible :)
until now I believe there are many projects in android app store that implement this kind of functionality
my main aim of this was to make an application that does not require rooting the phone and allowes re programming of an Arduino without changing it's code, just using the Arduinos default bootloader

android app to program the sumorobots with blockly
this can be used also for basis to program Arduino over Bluetooth
the aim of this project was to program any Arduino over Bluetooth without changing it's code
for that purpose the Arduino has to connect to a Bluetooth that can automatically reset it
I developed sumoshield, which is a breakout for Arduino UNO compatible boards + a Bluetooth interface
