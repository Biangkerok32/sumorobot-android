sumodroid
=========

android app to program the sumorobots with blockly
this can be used also for basis to program Arduino over Bluetooth
the aim of this project was to program any Arduino over Bluetooth without changing it's code
for that purpose the Arduino has to connect to a Bluetooth that can automatically reset it
I developed sumoshield, which is a breakout for Arduino UNO compatible boards + a Bluetooth interface
